            <p>Hello, welcome to my page! My name is Cindy, and I am known to use emojis like an 18 year old. I
                probably use the most emojis out of anyone I know at my company&hellip;</p>
            <p>I was born and raised in the Bay Area, specifically Oakland&mdash;been here pretty much all my life.</p>
            <p>I did relocate to South Florida for 18 months for my first job out of college. But since I missed my
                friends and family terribly, I was allowed to move back home. I still work for that very same
                company.</p>

            <p>I like to travel and experience what it&rsquo;s like to live in other parts of the world. I still
                have many countries in which I would like to visit, but so far I have been to: Canada, China,
                Japan, France, and Singapore. I&rsquo;ve traveled to many cities within the United States as well,
                but only ones along the Eastern and Western coasts. One of my bucket list items is to do a road
                trip and travel through all 48 contiguous states.</p>
